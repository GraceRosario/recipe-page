## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that instead of wrapping <li> on <span> or other tags like that to create space between bullet and it's content, it is better to do that by giving padding left to <li>

Sometimes, giving ading in vw is better insted of setting that rem for large padding. this makes it responsive even on the smaller screens.
